Text-based game for OOP assigment as part of MSc Computing Science module.
Final mark: 94% / Distinction.

This game was written in Java using pre-created interfaces from our professor. It demonstrates understanding of OOP principles including classes, inheritance, and objects.

The games 'plot' is to find the key to the 'truth' (hint: it is locked in one of the obstacles - you need to find the key).
